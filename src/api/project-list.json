            "This project was originally going to be about margins.",
            
            "But if the margin is there to be at the service of the center, perhaps it is necessary to reformulate the margin—to recast both its geographical and psychological implications. Or perhaps, the goal is to reiterate the margin as ultimately unknowable, its territory ambiguous, the boundaries between its paratext and the central text unresolvably blurry. Margins, after all, only become possible objects when a political distinction is made between the margin and the center.",
            
            "But even this goal of ambiguity may be an act of totalization, an act of cementing the margin’s inherenty quality as something that is unknowable. We learn from Said (and, perhaps, the way that imperialism has infiltrated the most minute details of our day-to-day interactions) that the western imperialist perceives the subaltern as “knowable and unknowing”. This is the idea that through colonialism, one can conceivably understand all aspects of a culture; a culture that is perhaps too underdeveloped, immature, or ignorant to understand themselves. On the other hand, it is often the case that the well-meaning post-colonial theorist becomes complicit in an epistemological othering, and posits the subaltern as unknowable and disenfranchised from knowing. Both ultimately leave no space for the “third world woman” to speak for herself.",
            
            "I began this project with a desire to reposition these texts from margin to center. But I soon became paralyzed with insecurity and uneasiness that I myself, while reading and compiling all of this postcolonial feminist theory, was buying into the voyeuristic impulse of aestheticizing and fetishizing marginality and the “third world woman.” I felt uneasy even with the act of anthologizing, of bringing texts together. I felt uneasy with the possibility that I was essentializing all discourse about the “third world women” as a monolithic text block — a literal volume, with distinct boundaries.",
            
            "Ostensibly, the texts in this book center around the figure of the “third world woman,” but it is worth taking the time now to point out that this analytic category of “third world woman” is colonialist for two reasons: one, it is a homogenizing categorization, and ignores the huge amount of heterogeny between actual “third world women”; two, the composite “othering” of third world women helps western feminism centralize and define itself against the backdrop of a margin.",
             
            "While I was working on this project, someone suggested to me that this anthology is also a project about pushing back against the splintering of knowledge — through compiling these texts, I am also breaking through pay-walls, dead links, and unsearchable PDFS, to make them more accessible. And while that provided some reassurance that what I was doing wasn't totally useless, the question still remained. This act of anthologizing, of consolidation: is it perhaps more harmful than it is productive?"
