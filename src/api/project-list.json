Even the visuality of the word itself—not necessarily the typographic choices used to render it, but the actual shape of the words and base letterforms themselves—can be regarded as objects with aesthetic values. Moreover, grouping words together in order to appeal to some historical or social taxonomy or system of classification creates further resonance between, drawing from shared cultural systems of knowledge."
