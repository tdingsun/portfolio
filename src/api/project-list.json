            "<i>For decades, researchers have studied how online communities form shared identities and beliefs. But what about shared memories? This series explores Lore: the new modes of self-mythologization developed within network media, and the forms of history and canon stored within media artifacts that online groups produce. The memes we encounter on clearnet feeds are usually parts of larger stories, stemming from semi-private sites more conducive to worldbuilding. The affordances of different types of online space change how information is produced, circulated, and remembered across platforms. What happens when platforms enable the archival of information? What happens when they encourage collective experiences versus personal, inward-facing ones?</i>",
            "<i>The way we remember the events that happen on the internet is different than reading a book. Information circulates and gets stored in a way that incorporates personal narratives as documentation, combining textuality with elements of oral storytelling. Bits of text and image serve as artifacts that help piece together complex narratives. The Lore Zone seeks to help us all understand new interesting ways of reading, writing, and remembering the internet.</i>"

The software identifies existing requests associated with topics of common interest that were previously denied on the basis of containing information 'classified' by authorities. This ever-increasing flow of unanswered civic concerns are organized as an interactive website that aims to register, through labyrinthine hyperlinks, the bureaucratic opacity and strategic silence of the country's administrative institutions.",

Even the visuality of the word itself—not necessarily the typographic choices used to render it, but the actual shape of the words and base letterforms themselves—can be regarded as objects with aesthetic values. Moreover, grouping words together in order to appeal to some historical or social taxonomy or system of classification creates further resonance between, drawing from shared cultural systems of knowledge."
